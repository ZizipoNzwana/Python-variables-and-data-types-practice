# Challenge 1: Print Numbers
# Write a for loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.
# for num in range(1, 11):
#     print(num)

# Challenge 2: Multiplication Table
# Ask the user for a number, then use a for loop to print its multiplication table up to 10.

# numbers = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# for num in range(10, 0, -1):
#     num * numbers
#     print(f"{numbers} x {num} = {num *numbers}")
# # total = 1
pass
# Challenge 2: Sum of Numbers
# Use a for loop to add up all the numbers from 1 to 100 and print the total.

# numbers = [ 3, 4, 5, 6]
# for num in numbers:
#     total *= num
# print(total)
pass
# Challenge 3: Count Vowels
# Write a program that loops through the string "programming" and counts how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are in it.

# sentence = "programming"
# vowels = "aeiou"
# count = 0

# for vowel in sentence:
#     sentence = sentence.lower()
#     if vowel in vowels:
#         count += 1
# print(count)
    
# Challenge 5: Reverse a Word
# Ask the user to enter a word. Use a for loop to print the word backwards.
# Example: "hello" → "olleh"

# sentence = input("Enter sentence: ")

# for word in sentence:
#     word = sentence[::-1].lower()
# print(word)


# WHILE LOOPS....
# Challenge 1: Countdown
# Write a program that starts at 10 and counts down to 1 using a while loop. After reaching 1, print "Blast off!".
# count_down = 10

# while count_down < 10:
#     count_down -= 1
# print(count_down)
